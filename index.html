	 		<p id="my-bio">Hi.  I'm Brad.  I spent 30 years providing credit to privately-held businesses for Wells Fargo and Bank of America.  I really like working with entrpreneurs to grow their businesses, make acquisitions, solve finanacing problems and make their communities a better place to live.  But 30 years was enough.  In March of 2015 I hiked the Appalachian Trail.  I started in Georgia and six months later summited Mt Khatadin in Maine.  2189.1 miles of wonderful trail magic!!!  Today I work for my wife who owns Acapella-Design and I am the Financial Liason to the Board of Directors of Childspring International, an NGO that provides life changing surgeries to children in developng nations.  I love the power and promise of technology. It will continue to change the world and make it a better place.</p>
