	<p>Hi.  I'm Brad.  I spent 30 years making loans to privately-held business for Wells Fargo and Bank of America.  I really like working with entrpreneurs to grow their businesses, make acquisitions, solve finanacing problems and make their communities a better place to live.  But 30 years was enough.  In March of 2015 I hiked the Appalachian Trail.  I left Georgia in March and six months later summited Mt Khatadin in Maine.  2189.1 miles of wonderful trail magic.  Today I support my wife who owns Acapella-Design and Childspring International an NGO that provides life changing surgeries to children in developng nations.  I love the power and promise of technology.
